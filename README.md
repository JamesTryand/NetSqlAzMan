*NetSqlAzMan is the .NET Sql Authorization Manager short form and is an applicative authorization manager, that is, given an application user, what this user is authorized to do within that application.*

*NetSqlAzMan* is for all *Microsoft .NET 4.0* developers that need to manage loosely-coupled applicative authorizations, that is, weakly coupled with source code, in a light and fast way having all these authorizations in a relational database such as *MS Sql Server* (2000/MSDE/2005/2008/2012/Express/Compact).
